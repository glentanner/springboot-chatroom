# Chat Room

This is a simple chat room application built using Spring Boot MVC, WebSockets, and STOMP. A login page is included to allow users to join the chat room and exchange messages with other users.

## Background
The WebSocket communication protocol makes it possible to establish a two-way communication channel between a server and a client.  The project was built in IntelliJ with Maven.

## Message model
The Message model is the message payload that is exchanged between the client and the server, with these basic actions:
1. ENTER
2. CHAT
3. LEAVE
